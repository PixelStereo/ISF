# User Fixtures Folder #
########################

You can add your own fixtures in this folder.
They must conform to the Open Lighting Format (OFL).

You can download them from the OFL website : https://open-fixture-library.org
Restarting Millumin will be necessary to take the changes into account.

Of course, you are welcome to add your own fixtures on https://open-fixture-library.org
Thus, everyone can benefit (by the way, regardless of the software).
